# (Python Interpreter for) DancingPy
## DancingPy is my new esolang idea
### About DancingPy:
DancingPy is my new esolang idea! Basicaly I revived SASAGELang but instead of memes, it's ABBA lyrics (yes i made ArnoldC, Python/ABBA version)  
Example syntax:
```py
MAMMA MIA HERE I GO AGAIN
  YOU ARE THE DANCING QUEEN function():
    CANT YOU HEAR ME SOS "Hello, world!"

  function()
THERES NOT A SOUL OUT THERE
```
What the code above does:  
`MAMMA MIA HERE I GO AGAIN` and `THERES NOT A SOUL OUT THERE` are ***mandatory***. They start and end the script respectively.  
`YOU ARE THE DANCING QUEEN` defines the function `function()`.  
`function()` is a hello world function. It prints "Hello, world!" with the help of `CANT YOU HEAR ME SOS`(*in python: `print()`*)

Coming soon for whoever wants to test it!  
(estimated date for the first beta release: july 13th 2023)
