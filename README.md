# SASAGELang
A C++-like esolang with a *little bit of different syntax...*

## Syntax
It's all memes\*, and each meme is equal to something in C++.  
Hello world example:
```c
Say the line Bart "Hello, world!"
```

`this language was made in Flex and Bison and compiled with LLVM in Windows 11. Got through some Bison flaws but OK.`

\**SASAGElang's name comes from the meme SASAGEYO SASAGEYO from the song* Shinzou wo sasageyo! *that's why this is a meme language(originally supposed to be a Chicken clone)*
